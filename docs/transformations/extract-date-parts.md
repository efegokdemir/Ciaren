# Extract date parts — `extractDateParts`

Add columns for parts of a date/datetime column.

## Use cases

- Add `year`/`month` columns to group sales by period.
- Pull `weekday` or `hour` for time-of-week analysis.

## What it does

Adds one new column per requested part, named `<column>_<part>`. All original
columns are preserved.

<DataTransform
  transform="Extract date parts (column=occurred_at, parts=[year, month])"
  :before='{
    "columns":["event_id","occurred_at","value"],
    "rows":[
      [1,"2024-01-05",10],[2,"2024-02-18",21],[3,"2024-03-01",17]
    ]
  }'
  :after='{
    "columns":["event_id","occurred_at","value","occurred_at_year","occurred_at_month"],
    "rows":[
      [1,"2024-01-05",10,2024,1],
      [2,"2024-02-18",21,2024,2],
      [3,"2024-03-01",17,2024,3]
    ]
  }'
  :highlight='["occurred_at_year","occurred_at_month"]'
/>

## Configuration

| Config key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `column` | string | Yes | Date/datetime column |
| `parts` | string[] | Yes | Any of `year`, `quarter`, `month`, `week`, `day`, `day_of_year`, `weekday`, `hour`, `minute` |

Each part becomes a new column named `<column>_<part>` (e.g. `ordered_at_year`).

## Generated Python code

```python
_dt = pd.to_datetime(df_1['ordered_at'])
df_2 = df_1.assign(ordered_at_year=_dt.dt.year, ordered_at_month=_dt.dt.month)
```

## Tips & common mistakes

- **`weekday` is Monday=0 … Sunday=6** (consistent across pandas and polars
  exports — verified by the parity tests).
- **`week` uses ISO-8601 week numbering** in both pandas and Polars. Weeks
  start on Monday, and week 1 is the first week with a Thursday in the calendar
  year, so dates near New Year can belong to the previous or next ISO week-year.
- If the source is text, [Parse dates](./parse-dates.md) or
  [Change types](./cast-types.md) → `datetime` first; this node also parses on the
  fly but an explicit parse is clearer.
